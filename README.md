As of right now, it is a simple model, using the previous 2 years of data to predict the upcoming season, is quite bad.

The big to-do as of right now is to add context.


Adding pillar 2, which is a draft buddy
Using recursion to try each positional picks for the starting lineup

Next steps are:
Adding a connection to sleeper
distinguishing between live pick and not
Making it specific for the first pick
going to general/a generic player view using a probability model

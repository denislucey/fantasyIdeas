As of right now, it is a simple model, using the previous 2 years of data to predict the upcoming season, is quite bad.

The big to-do as of right now is to add context.


Adding pillar 2, which is a draft buddy
Using recursion to try each positional picks for the starting lineup
Is now connected to sleeper and runs 8 rounds deep

I like that it is quick
I like that it is seamless and clear
I do not like how RB heavy it is (quad barrel!)
I do not like that it only looks at the top option (reaching for CaLose to an insane degree)
I do not like the current value calculation for a team

ToDo:
Redo value function
Expand draft (add recursion depth?)
Have the functions potentially look at two players:
BPA as well as the best available before next pick.
I also should redo my data properly, to something I agree with much more, currently only espn data
